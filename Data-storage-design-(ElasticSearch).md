The data is stored in ElasticSearch. The 2 indices used are **groups** and **users**.

## Groups

The `groups` index is used to store all the groups' information. Each group has the following properties:

* **id**: A unique identifier for the group. This id is generated by the data layer, leveraging the ElasticSearch painless script language.  
* **name**: The group name.
* **description**: The group description.
* **movies**:  An array with the movie IDs that are in the group.

## Users

The `users` index is used to store all the users' information. Each user has the following properties:

* **id**: A unique identifier for the user. This id is generated by the data layer, leveraging the ElasticSearch painless script language.
* **username**: The user username.
* **password**: The user password.
* **email**: The user email address.
* **groups**: An array of group ids that the user owns. This maps to the `groups` index.

## Mapping

The mapping between the ElasticSearch documents and the web application objects model is done using the following objects:

* **Group**: This class is used to represent a group. It has the same properties as the `groups` index.
* **User**: This class is used to represent a user. It has the same properties as the `users` index.
